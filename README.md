Steam-Info-Grabber - Search a game title in app and it grabs description, store link and downloads the game title thumbnail

I make a lot of youtube videos where I was constantly wasting time downloading thumbnail for games and copying the description and store link to put into video description. This allows you to type the title into the search box and it grabs the info for you. Might be useful for others.
